This challenge was posed by PSA; Singapore Ports of Authority.

## Context:
  - We were given data on the usage and platform traffic of PSA's proprietary software - PortNet
  - The data focused on the Haulier demographic
  - The data detailed the different actions these Hauliers used on PortNet
  - The data included the timing of these actions, which user performed the action, which organisation this user is from
  - We were given a separate data file detailing the browser and software platform that the user used to access PortNet
  
## Objective:
  - To analyse the data to find user patterns
  - To analyse the data to find the affects of Covid-19
  - To find ways and means to enhance the user experience
  - Many more. (Refer to the Context page of the Report)
 
## Notes:
  - Both Python and R codes were used for the analysis. R was used mostly for some visualisations. 
  - Bulk of the analysis and cleaning was done in Python
  - This Git should consist of several Python and R files, and only 1 PDF file detailing our findings and efforts.
